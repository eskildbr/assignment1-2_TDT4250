# assignment1_TDT4250

For this project I worked with Peder Hanch-Hansen Espen, username: phespen@stud.ntnu.no

We got familier with the program and tried to implement every feature and task that were specified in the assignment. However, due to limited time and other subjects we did not get to implement every detail.

We tried implementing derived feature to the lecturer class, in a similar way that was done in class by the attributes 'name', 'givenName' and 'fullName' and wrote the code for this in the lecturer.java files. We also tried to implement constraints, but did not get the expected outcome and will look further into this after the assignment is due.

We did not quite understand the use of enums and how to implement this in the model. We wanted to have a semester as enum so that one can choose between fall/spring, but did not understand how this could be referenced and added.
