# Assignment1-TDT4250


This Assignment was done in cooperation with Eskild Brobak (eskildbr@stud.ntnu.no).

We got familiar with the program, but did struggle with certain tasks. We also had limited time due to other courses and projects that were due at a similar time.

We tried implementing derived features per the lecture, and we think we managed to do it. Implementing constraints via OCL was not possible due to time constraints, but we will take some time to implement this after the delivery date for our own learning (we did implement a constraint via changing the generated code).

We also didnt quite understand the usage of enums. We initially wanted to add "semester" as a binding point between year and courses, but since EEnums cant be referenced it was difficult. So we decided againts using EENums or EDatatypes this assignment, but will research them further.
